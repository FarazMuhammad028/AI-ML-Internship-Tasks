# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset
in order to understand data trends, patterns, and distributions.

---

## 📊 Dataset Used
- **Dataset Name:** Iris Dataset
- **Source:** CSV format (loaded using Seaborn / Pandas)
- **Description:**  
  The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers with the following features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width  

  The dataset includes three flower species:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica

---

## 🧹 Data Loading and Inspection
- Loaded the dataset using **Pandas**
- Displayed dataset shape (rows and columns)
- Printed column names
- Displayed the first few rows using `.head()`
- Used `.info()` to inspect data types and null values
- Used `.describe()` to generate summary statistics

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset was explored using various visualization techniques:

### 🔹 Scatter Plots
- Visualized relationships between features
- Observed separation between different flower species

### 🔹 Histograms
- Analyzed the distribution of individual features
- Identified skewness and spread of values

### 🔹 Box Plots
- Identified potential outliers
- Compared feature distributions across species

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Key Observations and Findings
- The dataset is clean with no missing values
- Petal features show strong differentiation among species
- Setosa species is clearly separable from others
- Visualization helps in understanding feature importance

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This task demonstrates the importance of data exploration and visualization before
building machine learning models. Understanding data patterns and distributions
helps in making informed decisions during model development.
