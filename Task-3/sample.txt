Dataset:
Telco Churn Dataset
Instructions:
● Implement data preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, encoding) using Pipeline
● Train models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest
● Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Skills Gained:
● ML pipeline construction
● Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch

● Model export and reusability
● Production-readiness practices

Task 3: Multimodal ML – Housing Price Prediction Using Images + Tabular
Data
Objective:
Predict housing prices using both structured data and house images.
Dataset:
Housing Sales Dataset + Custom Image Dataset (your own or any public source)
Instructions:
● Use CNNs to extract features from images
● Combine extracted image features with tabular data
● Train a model using both modalities
● Evaluate performance using MAE and RMSE

Skills Gained:
● Multimodal machine learning
● Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
● Feature fusion (image + tabular)
● Regression modeling and evaluation

Task 4: Context-Aware Chatbot Using LangChain or RAG
Objective:
Build a conversational chatbot that can remember context and retrieve external information

during conversations.
Dataset:
Custom corpus (e.g., Wikipedia pages, internal documents, or any knowledge base)
Instructions:
● Use LangChain or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
● Implement context memory for conversational history
● Retrieve answers from a vectorized document store
● Deploy the chatbot with Streamlit

Skills Gained:
● Conversational AI development
● Document embedding and vector search
● Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
● LLM integration and deployment

Task 5: Auto Tagging Support Tickets Using LLM
Objective:
Automatically tag support tickets into categories using a large language model (LLM).
Dataset:
Free-text Support Ticket Dataset
Instructions:
● Use prompt engineering or fine-tuning with an LLM
● Compare zero-shot vs fine-tuned performance
● Apply few-shot learning techniques to improve accuracy

● Output top 3 most probable tags per ticket
Skills Gained:
● Prompt engineering
● LLM-based text classification
● Zero-shot and few-shot learning
● Multi-class prediction and ranking
